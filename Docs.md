1. Project Overview
Project Name: 
Simple Staking Protocol
Goal: Build a multi-contract staking protocol that allows users to stake tokens, earn rewards over time, and manage their staked balance. The system should include features for staking, unstaking, reward accumulation, and pausing functionality for emergency scenarios. This design involves at least two contracts: one for managing the staking logic and one for the token (an ERC20 implementation).

Why This Project?
Real-World Application
: Staking protocols are widely used in decentralized finance (DeFi) to incentivize token holding and network participation.
Multi-Contract Interaction
: Gain experience with inter-contract communication by interacting with a token contract.
Core Solidity Practices
: Learn about state management, reward calculation, access control, pausing mechanisms, and secure token transfers.
Testing and Validation
: Develop a suite of tests using Gherkin-style scenarios to ensure robust functionality and understand user flows.
Outcome
Contracts
:
A 
Token Contract
 (ERC20) that users will stake.
A 
Staking Contract
 handling staking operations, rewards management, and pausing.
Tests
: Gherkin-based scenarios that outline expected behaviors and interactions.
Deployment Setup
: A project configured with Foundry or Hardhat for local testing and deployment.
2. Documentation / Specifications
System Components
Token Contract
Purpose
: A simple ERC20 token that will be used for staking.
Key Functions
: Standard ERC20 functions such as 
transfer
, 
transferFrom
, and 
balanceOf
.
Note
: Use OpenZeppelin’s ERC20 implementation to simplify development.
Staking Contract
Core Functions
:
stake(uint256 amount)
: Allows users to stake a specified amount of tokens.
unstake(uint256 amount)
: Allows users to withdraw a portion of their staked tokens.
claimRewards()
: Enables users to claim their accumulated rewards.
pause()
 / 
unpause()
: Permits the owner to halt and resume staking operations.
Data Structures
:
Staked Balances
: 
mapping(address => uint256) stakes
Reward Tracking
: A method to calculate and store pending rewards (e.g., using a reward debt mechanism).
Total Staked Amount
: A state variable to track the overall amount staked.
Reward Rate
: A parameter that defines the reward per block or per time unit.
Roles
:
Owner
: Can pause/unpause the contract and modify reward parameters.
Users
: Stake tokens to earn rewards.
Events
:
Staked(address indexed user, uint256 amount)
Unstaked(address indexed user, uint256 amount)
RewardsClaimed(address indexed user, uint256 reward)
Paused()
Unpaused()
Reward Calculation
Mechanism
: Rewards could be calculated based on the staked amount and a fixed reward rate per block or per time interval.
Considerations
: Ensure accurate reward tracking when users stake, unstake, or claim rewards. Handle edge cases such as frequent staking/unstaking and potential rounding issues.
Pause Functionality
Purpose
: Enable the contract owner to halt operations during emergencies or maintenance.
Behavior
:
When paused, functions like 
stake
, 
unstake
, and 
claimRewards
 should revert.
Only privileged functions (such as 
unpause
) should operate while the contract is paused.
3. Gherkin-Style Scenarios
3.1 Staking Tokens
Scenario: User stakes tokens successfully
  Given a deployed Token contract with an initial token balance for user "Alice"
  And a deployed Staking contract with a reward rate of 0.1% per block
  When Alice approves the Staking contract to spend 100 tokens
  And Alice calls "stake(100)" on the Staking contract
  Then the contract should log a "Staked" event with (Alice, 100)
  And Alice's staked balance should be 100 tokens
  And the total staked amount in the contract should increase by 100 tokens

3.2 Unstaking Tokens
Scenario: User unstakes tokens successfully
  Given Alice has previously staked 100 tokens
  When Alice calls "unstake(50)" on the Staking contract
  Then the contract should log an "Unstaked" event with (Alice, 50)
  And Alice's staked balance should decrease to 50 tokens
  And the total staked amount should decrease by 50 tokens

3.3 Claiming Rewards
Scenario: User claims accumulated rewards
  Given Alice has staked tokens and a number of blocks have passed
  When Alice calls "claimRewards()"
  Then the contract should calculate rewards based on the staked amount and reward rate
  And log a "RewardsClaimed" event with (Alice, calculatedReward)
  And Alice's reward balance should reset or update appropriately after the claim

3.4 Pausing the Staking Contract
Scenario: Owner pauses the contract
  Given the Staking contract is active
  When the owner calls "pause()"
  Then the contract should log a "Paused" event
  And any subsequent calls to "stake", "unstake", or "claimRewards" should revert with "Contract is paused"

3.5 Unpausing the Staking Contract
Scenario: Owner unpauses the contract
  Given the Staking contract is paused
  When the owner calls "unpause()"
  Then the contract should log an "Unpaused" event
  And normal operations (stake, unstake, claimRewards) should resume successfully

4. Implementation Tips & Getting Started
Project Setup

Initialize a new project using Foundry or Hardhat.
Create two contracts: one for the ERC20 token (using OpenZeppelin’s implementation) and one for the Staking logic.
Organize your files in a 
contracts/
 directory and your tests in a 
test/
 directory.
Contract Structure

Token Contract Example:

​​​​// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
​​​​pragma solidity 0.8.26;
​​​​
​​​​import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol";
​​​​
​​​​contract MyToken is ERC20 { // add your own name
​​​​    [...]
​​​​}
​​​​
Staking Contract Skeleton:

​​​​// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
​​​​pragma solidity 0.8.26;
​​​​
​​​​import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/IERC20.sol";
​​​​import "@openzeppelin/contracts/access/Ownable.sol";
​​​​import "@openzeppelin/contracts/security/Pausable.sol";
​​​​
​​​​contract Staking is Ownable, Pausable {
​​​​    IERC20 public stakingToken;
​​​​    uint256 public totalStaked;
​​​​    uint256 public rewardRate; // Reward per block or per time unit
​​​​
​​​​    mapping(address => uint256) public stakes;
​​​​    mapping(address => uint256) public rewardDebt; // For reward tracking
​​​​
​​​​    event Staked(address indexed user, uint256 amount);
​​​​    event Unstaked(address indexed user, uint256 amount);
​​​​    event RewardsClaimed(address indexed user, uint256 reward);
​​​​    event Paused();
​​​​    event Unpaused();
​​​​
​​​​    [...]
​​​​}
​​​​
Testing

Write tests for each function using the Gherkin scenarios above.
Use tools like Foundry’s 
vm.warp
 or 
vm.roll
 to simulate block time advancement.
Ensure proper handling of edge cases such as attempting operations when the contract is paused.
5. Additional Challenges (Optional)
Dynamic Reward Rate
: Allow the owner to adjust the reward rate.
Early Unstake Penalty
: Implement a penalty for unstaking before a specified lock-up period.
6. Wrap-Up
Key Points to Emphasize:

This project simulates a real-world request by involving multiple contracts and more complex functionality.
Detailed documentation and Gherkin scenarios provide clear guidance while leaving room for experimentation and learning.
Focus on security, edge-case handling, and thorough testing to build a robust staking protocol.
Good luck! Enjoy the challenge of building your Simple Staking Protocol and deepening your Solidity skills.
